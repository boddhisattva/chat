This is a basic chat application that has been implemented in Ruby. This application was last tested using Ruby 1.9.3-p327 .

To get some background information on this application you can refer to - http://boddhisattvadedicates.blogspot.in/2011/08/chat-application-using-ruby.html .

To run the server side script datagram_server.rb, a sample command that you need to hit from your terminal instance is:-

ruby datagram_server.rb 12345
--> Here 12345 stands for the port number.

To run the client side script datagram_client.rb, a sample command is:-

ruby datagram_client.rb localhost 12345
--> Here
- localhost is your hostname
- 12345 stands for the port number	

Hope this gets you going. 

Cheers :)
